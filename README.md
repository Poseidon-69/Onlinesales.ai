Programming Questions
This repository contains solutions to three programming questions. Each question has its own folder with the corresponding code and additional resources.

Q1: Dice Roll Simulation
Problem Statement
The problem involves writing a program that simulates rolls of two dice and calculates the occurrences of each sum from 2 to 12. The probabilities for each sum are provided using a HashMap. The program uses a Random object to generate random dice rolls and stores the results in another HashMap.

Code
The solution for this question can be found in the Q1 folder.

Additional Implementation
In addition to the provided code, the solution for Q1 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Java Swing.

Q2: Mathematical Expression Evaluation
Problem Statement
The problem involves writing a program that accepts multiple mathematical expressions and evaluates each of them using a public Web API. The program should display the result of each expression on the console.

Code
The solution for this question can be found in the Q2 folder.

Additional Implementation
Similar to Q1, the solution for Q2 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Java Swing.

Q3: Debugging
Problem Statement
The problem involves identifying and fixing bugs in a Bash/Python script that performs various computations based on an integer input. The bugs need to be corrected to ensure the correct output.

Code
The solution for this question can be found in the Q3 folder.
