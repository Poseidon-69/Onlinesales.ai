Q1Dice
Problem Statement
Write a program that simulates rolls of two dice and calculates the occurrences of each sum from 2 to 12. The probabilities for each sum are provided using a HashMap. The program uses a Random object to generate random dice rolls and stores the results in another HashMap.

Execution
Follow these steps to execute the code:

Open a text editor and create a new file.
Copy the Java code provided into the file.
Save the file with the name Q1Dice.java. Make sure to use the .java extension.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Java file.
Compile the Java file by running the following command: javac Q1Dice.java
This will generate a bytecode file named Q1Dice.class in the same directory if there are no compilation errors.
Run the compiled Java program by executing the following command: java Q1Dice
This will run the program, and the output will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.
Note: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system and the javac and java commands are accessible from the command line.

Unit Test Cases

Unit Test Cases are attached includes a single test method testSimulateRolls(), which tests the simulateRolls() method of the Q1Dice class. It verifies that the occurrences of each sum match the expected occurrences defined in the test case.

To run these test cases, you'll need to set up a testing framework such as JUnit in your development environment. Make sure to include the necessary dependencies and configurations for running JUnit tests.
